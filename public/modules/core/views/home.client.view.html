			<h2>Welcome to Extrovert!</h2>
			<p>Sup. I'm Sam aka. Kuiche - a developer, hacker and apparently now a <a href="/blog">blogger</a>.</p>
			<p>
				This site is a portfolio of things I have done, things I am doing. Things I am proud of. There's a load of stuff going on in this site. Head over to <a href="/#!/experiments">experiments</a> for a list of interesting fun projects, my <a href="/blog">blog</a> for news and info on recent projects. Visit my <a href="/#!/portfolio">portfolio</a> for a list of more professional things I have worked on and '<a href="/#!/about">about</a>' does exactly what you'd expect.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may have noticed that this site has a <a href="/#!/signin">signin</a> link. This is used in a bunch of the <a href="/#!/experiments">experiments</a> on the site. Don't worry about it if you're just looking around.
			</p>
			
			<h2>So... this site's buggy as shit.</h2>
			<p>
				This site is my first <a href="//nodejs.org">node.js</a> application. It is in itself an experement. Pretty much everything on here is on Github, so if there's any bugs that are REALLY bugging you (god I hate puns), submit an <a href="https://github.com/kuiche/extrovert/issues">issue</a> :D.
